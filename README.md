# smart-console

Simple JavaScript library that provides shortcuts to manage the console methods and to add colors.

Every method of the console object (for more info see: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/console) and
[Google API](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/console-reference)) has a name shortcut and predefined colors can be added to the log() messages:
* Success
* Info
* Warning
* Danger


__The script must run on a server otherwise the cookie is not set up__
