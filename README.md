# smart-console

Simple JavaScript and lightweight library that provides shortcuts to manage the console methods and to add colours.
Suitable for browsers and for NodeJS.

Every console object method (for more info see: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/console) and
[Google API](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/console-reference)) has a name shortcut and predefined colors can be added to the log() messages:
* Success
* Info
* Warning
* Danger

__The script may have different effects depending on the browser that is used__

File structure:
* index.html         - Shows examples of all available console logs. 
* browser directory  - Contains 2 files suitable to be included for use within a browser console. One is minified. 
* nodejs directory   - Contains the file necessary for including within a nodejs project.
